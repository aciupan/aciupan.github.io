Here are some of my research and expository papers in computer science and economics.


#### Computer Science

*   [Shor's Algorithm](/assets/pdf/Shor.pdf)

After taking quantum computing (math 162) in college and cryptography (cs 227) in grad school, I decided to write a self-contained paper introducing quantum computing and proving Shor's quantum computing algorithm for breaking RSA encryption.

*   [Derandomized Squaring of Graphs](/assets/pdf/Derandsq.pdf)

This is the final project for a computational complexity course (cs 221). We describe the [paper of Rozeman and Vadhan](https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~salil/research/derand_squaring-abs.html). They introduce a new technique for proving that the problem of outputting a path between two vertices in a graph can be solved in log space.

#### Economics

I have done research in auction theory and market design, with professors [Eric Maskin](https://scholar.harvard.edu/maskin/home) and [Scott Kominers] (https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=500905)

* [Preference cycles in stable matchings] (/assets/pdf/Prefcycles.pdf)

One of the problems I have been thinking about is how to connect the preference profile of a set of agents to the set of corresponding stable matchings. There are a few results about properties of stable matchings (in 1-1 matching, for example, there always exists a stable matching, and in case there are multiple stable matchings, the set of matched agents is invariant). In this paper I introduce a combinatorial object which ties any two stable matchings, and prove a number of fundamental results from matching theory in an elementary way.
