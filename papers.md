Here are some of my research and expository papers in computer science and economics.


#### Computer Science

*   [Shor's Algorithm](/assets/pdf/Shor.pdf)

After taking quantum computing (math 162) in college and cryptography (cs 227) in grad school, I decided to write a self-contained paper introducing quantum computing and proving Shor's quantum computing algorithm for breaking RSA encryption.

*   [Derandomized Squaring of Graphs](/assets/pdf/Derandsq.pdf)

This is the final project for a computational complexity course (cs 221). We describe the [paper of Rozeman and Vadhan](https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~salil/research/derand_squaring-abs.html). They introduce a new technique for proving that the problem of outputting a path between two vertices in a graph can be solved in log space.
