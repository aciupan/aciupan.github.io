I am excited about teaching math-related topics, including SAT Math and probability to motivated students!

I am currently teaching SAT Math to 10+ motivated high school students, through [Upgrade Education](https://www.linkedin.com/company/upgradeeducation/mycompany/).

While I was an undergrad and master's student at Harvard, I was a course assistant for the following courses:
- Math 143 Set Theory
- Math 155 Combinatorics
- Econ 2099 Market Design

I taught weekly sections, graded and helped compose problem sets.

During undergrad summers I was an instructor at [Awesomemath](https://www.awesomemath.org/what-is-awesomemath/), where I taught olympiad-level combinatorics, number theory and geometry to gifted students for a total of 12 weeks.
