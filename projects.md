Here are some of my research and expository papers in computer science and economics.

## Computer Science

*   [Shor's Algorithm](/assets/pdf/Shor.pdf)

This paper introduces quantum computing and proves Shor's quantum computing algorithm for breaking RSA encryption. I like the fact that it is self-contained.

*   [Derandomized Squaring of Graphs](/assets/pdf/Derandsq.pdf)

This is the final project for a computational complexity course (cs 221). We describe the [paper of Rozeman and Vadhan](https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~salil/research/derand_squaring-abs.html). They introduce a new technique for proving that S-T connectivity can be solved in logspace.

## Economics

I have done research in auction theory and market design, with professors [Eric Maskin](https://scholar.harvard.edu/maskin/home) and [Scott Kominers](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=500905)

* [Efficient Auctions With Common Values](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08568)

This was my undergraduate senior thesis, under the guidance of professors [Eric Maskin](https://scholar.harvard.edu/maskin/home) and [Barry Mazur](http://www.math.harvard.edu/~mazur/).

In an earlier paper, Maskin and Dasgupta provide an efficient auction setup for the case of multiple goods, common values and one-dimensional signals. I provide an efficient auction setup for multi-dimensional goods as well, under a linear utility restriction.
