*   Composing music with recurrent neural networks

Using a recurrent neural network infrastructure trained on [a dataset of folk tunes](https://github.com/jukedeck/nottingham-dataset), I wrote a program which composes new songs. Here are some sample compositions: [1](/assets/mp3/song2.mp3), [2](/assets/mp3/song4.mp3), [3](/assets/mp3/song5.mp3), [4](/assets/mp3/song6.mp3), [5](/assets/mp3/song7.mp3), [6](/assets/mp3/song8.mp3), [7](/assets/mp3/song10.mp3), [8](/assets/mp3/song11.mp3), [9](/assets/mp3/song12.mp3).

The writeup is [here](/assets/mp3/song11.mp3) and the code is available [here](/assets/mp3/song11.mp3).
