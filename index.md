Hi! I'm Andrei Ciupan. I graduated from Harvard (Mathematics B.A. '14, Economics M.A. '18). I'm interested in research in computer science and statistics. Check out [my papers](/papers/), [projects](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jGlpdfU542vuV1kfDjAer07wom8BMl5R#scrollTo=IFIBSFUv1vi_) and [github](https://github.com/aciupan).
